Linear Regression Model training with REgularization and using Hyperparameter tunning
1. Problem statement
2. import important libraries
3. Data Gathering - California housing dataset-inbuilt dataset
4. EDA- All data is is umeric format and not null values, hence skipped EDA, outliers not handled
5. Assumptions- Linearity, No multicolinearity and its viscualization using seaborn library
6. Model Building- Linear Regression model
7. Evaluation metrics on Linear regression - Model is underfitting
8. Ridge regression model(alpha=1(default))
9. Evaluation metrics on Ridge regression- model is underfitting not much difference
10. Lasso regression model(alpha=1(default))
11. Evaluation metrics on Lasso Regression- variance is decreased but model is underfitting
12. GridSearchCV and Randomized Search CV on Ridge regression - Model is underfitting
13. GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV on Lasso Regression- Variance is decreased but model is underfitting
